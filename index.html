				<h2>Hi, I'm Zach Fink, I'm a web designer in San Diego, CA</h2>
				<p>I've been designing websites since the mid 90's when I started as a summer job in high school. More recently I've worked at San diego Gas &amp; Electric as the lead visual and usability designer for the web team.</p>
				<p>In addition to web desig, I am trained as an illustrator, have spent extensive time programming in ActioScript, and have received training in usability and UX design. I bring a strongly diverse set of skills to the web design discipline, creating sites that are both beautiful and useful.</p>

						</div>
						<p>I've worked at <a href="http://www.sdge.com">San Diego Gas &amp; Electric</a> as the lead web visual and user experience designer for over five years with three major redesigns.</p>
						<p>Our newest site utilizes Drupal for the backend CMS and is responsively 	optimized to work on any device and screen resolution.</p>
						<p>We took analytics and user feedback into consideration, reducing the collective height of the banner, rotating images, and Twitter feed to bring more content into viewable range of average screen resolutions.</p>
						<p>We also addressed business feedback by creating "Customer Service Grid", providing frequently-used links in an attractive grid that has tested well with users.</p>

					<p>The SDG&amp;E iPhone app was launched in 2011, and presented a challenge of content: we did not have access to customers' real-time data to present real-time usage, the obvious best use of an app. </p>
					<p>We opted instead to produce a home cost calculator using availabe date on average appliance costs and based the UX workflow on diet and fitness apps, allowing the user to calculate current usage as well as chart ways to reduce their use.</p>
					<p>I designed the UI, UX and produced all the graphic assets, ensuring SDG&amp;E's first mobile app took advantage of new (for the company at the time) technology while retaining brand principles and consitency with other digital channels.</p>
					<p>To date, the SDG&amp;E iPhone app has gone through a major redesign, added functionality inculding usage presentment, and expanded to the Android market as well.</p>

				<h2>Illustration</h2>
				<p>Everybody loves a good infographic, even when there isn't really enough data to justify having one!</p> 
				<p>Fortunately, I have been able to leverage my illustration skills to produce infographics that do not fall flat even with scant information.</p>
